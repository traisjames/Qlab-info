# QLab-info

qlab labels.rtf
  The actual file I pull color labels and special symbols from.  Note that after the name in color is a whitish *.  You delete this and then add text which will then match the regular note text color and form.
  
  4 Special Symbols:
    ••:         Indicates I am taking the go off of a visual action.  Option + 8 makes this symbol.
    ❖           Indicates that I am waiting for the SM to call this cue.  I use Mac's built in text subsitution to make this symbol.
    ⏎           The marker of when to actually hit the button.  I use Mac's built in text subsitution to make this symbol (R*).
    ♫           I forgot how I usually use this one.
